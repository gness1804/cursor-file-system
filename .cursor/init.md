# Cursor Instructions CLI Project

I want to create a CLI that enables one to manage Cursor instructions documents within an opinionated framework. These instruction documents are for Cursor agents for various stages of a project. This CLI will enable the user to create, edit, and manage Cursor documents for agents within the following file structure:

```sh
project/
    ├── .cursor 
    |   |__rules/ # Rules used by Cursor. See the Cursor rule `~/cursor-commands/create_cursor_rules.md` for details. This is the only subdirectory that will automatically be read by the Cursor agent. All others will contain documents that the user will need to manually share with the agent.
        |__research/ # For research related to the project. Could be things like investigating local restaurants for a restaurant listing app, or car dealerships for an app built to save users money on car purchases, etc. 
        |__bugs/ # For bug-related instructions. Usually instructions for investigating a bug. 
        |__features/ # Docs for agents to build out features
        |__refactors/ # Docs related to refactoring. 
        |__docs/ # Instructions to create documentation such as README files
        |__progress/ # Documents that keep track of progress on the various initiatives or the overall project. These will often be documents generated by Cursor agents at the request of the user for purposes such as handing off work to a new agent. These records should document the current progress on the project, what was tried to fix a bug, and anything else relevant to a new agent taking over.
        |__qa/ # Testing and QA-related documents. 
        |__tmp/ # A place to store temporary files that the Cursor agent creates for its own uses, but that will not be useful to the user or other developers after solving the immediate problem. In many repos, this directory will be version controlled.
        |__init.md # Optional file to instruct a Cursor agent on a new project, basic idea, basic setup, language(s) to be used, etc. Like the current document.
```

For more details on this file system and the rationale for it, see the Cursor command file `~/cursor-commands/cursor_semantic_scaffolding.md`

## Main Components of this Project

This project will be a CLI that allows users to create, edit, view, and delete files and folders within the Cursor File Structure (CFS) detailed above. I imagine it as a bit like the GitHub CLI that allows you to create, edit, and delete GitHub issues. But this will be specifically for the CFS. 

The main namespace for this CLI will be `cfs`. 

Some example commands:

- `cfs init`: Creates the entire CFS with blank files; similar to what the Cursor command `cursor_semantic_scaffolding` above does. Also creates an `init.md` file in the root of the CFS (`.cursor/init.md`)
- `cfs instructions bugs create`: creates a new instructions doc (in `.md` format; may expand to other formats later) in the `bugs` directory. All documents will automatically be prepended with an ID that is simply an integer; each directory starts with 1, then 2, etc. So for example, a file in the `bugs` directory could be called `2-fix-daily-script-hanging`. Or `3-features-add-admin-dashboard`. 
    - On new file create, user will be prompted if they want to complete the document contents using a text editor (Vim, Nano, IDE, etc) during the creation process, or if they prefer to just edit the file after creation, separate from the creation process. Similar to what GitHub CLI does when creating a new issue.
