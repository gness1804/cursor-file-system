# Cursor Instructions CLI Project

I want to create a CLI that enables one to manage Cursor instructions documents within an opinionated framework. These instruction documents are for Cursor agents for various stages of a project. This CLI will enable the user to create, edit, and manage Cursor documents for agents within the following file structure:

```sh
project/
    ├── .cursor 
    |   |__rules/ # Rules used by Cursor. See the Cursor rule `~/cursor-commands/create_cursor_rules.md` for details. This is the only subdirectory that will automatically be read by the Cursor agent. All others will contain documents that the user will need to manually share with the agent.
        |__research/ # For research related to the project. Could be things like investigating local restaurants for a restaurant listing app, or car dealerships for an app built to save users money on car purchases, etc. 
        |__bugs/ # For bug-related instructions. Usually instructions for investigating a bug. 
        |__features/ # Docs for agents to build out features
        |__refactors/ # Docs related to refactoring. 
        |__docs/ # Instructions to create documentation such as README files
        |__progress/ # Documents that keep track of progress on the various initiatives or the overall project. These will often be documents generated by Cursor agents at the request of the user for purposes such as handing off work to a new agent. These records should document the current progress on the project, what was tried to fix a bug, and anything else relevant to a new agent taking over.
        |__qa/ # Testing and QA-related documents. 
        |__tmp/ # A place to store temporary files that the Cursor agent creates for its own uses, but that will not be useful to the user or other developers after solving the immediate problem. In many repos, this directory will be version controlled.
        |__init.md # Optional file to instruct a Cursor agent on a new project, basic idea, basic setup, language(s) to be used, etc. Like the current document.
```

For more details on this file system and the rationale for it, see the Cursor command file `~/cursor-commands/cursor_semantic_scaffolding.md`

## Main Components of this Project

This project will be a CLI that allows users to create, edit, view, and delete files and folders within the Cursor File Structure (CFS) detailed above. I imagine it as a bit like the GitHub CLI that allows you to create, edit, and delete GitHub issues. But this will be specifically for the CFS. 

The main namespace for this CLI will be `cfs`. 

### Some example commands

- `cfs init`: Creates the entire CFS with blank files; similar to what the Cursor command `cursor_semantic_scaffolding` above does. Also creates an `init.md` file in the root of the CFS (`.cursor/init.md`)
- `cfs instructions bugs create`: creates a new instructions doc (in `.md` format; may expand to other formats later) in the `bugs` directory. All documents will automatically be prepended with an ID that is simply an integer; each document starts with 1, then 2, etc. So for example, a file in the `bugs` directory could be called `2-fix-daily-script-hanging`. Or `3-features-add-admin-dashboard`. 
    - On new file create, user will be prompted if they want to complete the document contents using a text editor (Vim, Nano, IDE, etc) during the creation process, or if they prefer to just edit the file after creation, separate from the creation process. Similar to what GitHub CLI does when creating a new issue. 
- `cfs instructions bugs edit 2-fix-multiple-items-appearing` or `cfs instructions bugs edit 2`: like `cfs instructions <directory> create`, except that the user is editing an existing issue. Use would edit the issue inline in the CLI when running this command. (They wouldn't need to run this command to edit the file directly in an IDE etc.)
    - The document id, discussed above, would be sufficient along with the containing folder to identify a file without the full file name. (Same for other operations such as `delete`.) 
- `cfs instructions refactors delete 1-make-modal-dry` or `cfs instructions refactors delete 1`: similar to `edit` but for deleting an instructions doc. User should be prompted for confirmation before deletion takes place. 
- `cfs instructions view` - lists all files within the full CFS file tree.
- `cfs instructions research view` - lists all files within a given CFS file.
- There should also be a command to create a new Cursor rules doc based on the parent repo (or on a more specific concern).

### Other components
- Maybe a boilerplate section within `init.md` that informs the Cursor agent of the meaning of this file structure and allows the user to use shorthands with the agent similar to the commands above. For instance, with this context, a user could instruct the agent "Outline a series of steps to solve my bug with X, and document these steps in a new doc within 'progress.'" Or, "edit refactors/2 to add..." And the Cursor LLM should probably always be instructed to create WIP/steps/handoff documents in 'progress', along with guidance on which documents to create in the rest of the folders. 
- A good README.md describing the purpose and nature of this project.

## Project phases

### MVP
Basically a CRUD application for the CFS. Contains operations noted above. Instructs Cursor agents on the purpose of each folder in the CFS and what types of documents to create/edit in each. Ideally, if you tell a Cursor agent something like, "Create a plan to see if an app like this has been built before and if so, how it differs from my proposed approach," the agent would know to generate that doc in `research/`. 

### Verson 2.0
CFS app should be able to integrate with GitHub issues. This should be a two-way relationship. For instance, there should be an option to linka CFS doc with a GitHub issue. You should be able to import text from a GitHub issue into a CFS doc, and vice versa (if GitHub CLI allows this). Also, if a GitHub issue is closed, then the corresponding CFS doc should be annotated to note that it's resolved. 

### Version 3.0
CFS app should integrate with the existing Cursor Agent CLI. (https://cursor.com/blog/cli) For instance, there might be a new command `cursor-agent create-chat cfs instructions bugs/3` which would create a new Cursor agent involving the doc with ID of 3 in `<project>/.cursor/bugs`. The Cursor agent would know that this doc is part of its context; its focus would be on solving this bug unless the user told it otherwise. 

### Version 4.0 and beyond
Who knows...
- MCP integrations
- Integrations with other services like Gitlab, Slack, Discord, etc. (For instance, a Slack bot could alert you when a CFS doc has been finished or could allow you to create a new doc right from Slack.)

### Other details
- I would like the CLI to be in Python if possible. 
- Follow the CFS system in assisting me to build this project. 
- Create a series of steps to complete before implementing any of the work. 
- Get my authorization before implementing any of the work and between each step.
