# Editing A Recipe With Zed Create A File That Doesnt Persist

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

When I try to edit a file using the Zed option, The application creates a temporary file to work in. After I save and close the temporary file, it doesn't persist. It just leaves an empty skeleton document in the file tree instead. I need the Zed option to actually edit the same file that was created to allow it to persist. 

## Acceptance criteria

- User will be able to select the Zed option when they want to edit a file. The resulting file will be the same file that's already been created, and it will persist normally to the repository.

<!-- DONE -->
