# Add Ability To View Only Incomplete Issues

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

Right now, when you run `cfs instructions features view`, it lists all of the issues in this folder, whether or not they are completed. I would like to add a functionality to only show the incomplete ones. It would probably be a flag such as `--incomplete-only` or `-i`. When this flag is passed in, the program would only show incomplete issues in this category. The same would happen if you run the command without a category, where it would ordinarily show all issues.
