# Provide More Options For Editing An Instruction File On Creation

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

Right now, after you create a new document, Cursor will ask you if you want to edit it. If you say yes, it will go into your default editor such as Vim. I want to add an option to select an editor, for instance, VSCode cursor, etc. When the option pops up to allow the user to edit the newly created document, there should be a drop-down style list of documents. The option should include:
- Various editors
- An option to use the default editor
- An option to not use an editor at all
For instance, you pressed yes that you want to edit, but then you changed your mind.

This will make editing a bit more helpful and user-friendly.
