# Add Ability To Uncomplete An Issue

## Working directory

Right now, you can complete an issue by typing `cfs instructions features complete 2`. I would like to add functionality to do the reverse, to uncomplete a completed issue. The command would be `cfs instructions features uncomplete 2`. This would do the reverse of the complete script:. It would remove the word "done" from the title and remove any notes inside of the documents saying that the document is done.
