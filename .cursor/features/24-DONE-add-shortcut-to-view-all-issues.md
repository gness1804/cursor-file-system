# Add Shortcut To View All Issues

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

Right now, the best way, the only way to view all incomplete issues is `cfs i view -i`. That's a bit cumbersome to type. Instead, we should have a shortcut or an alias which is `cfs view.` This will do the same thing as the other command. It will show all CFS issues for the project that are incomplete. 

## Acceptance criteria

- `cfs view` Will be an alias for `cfs i view -i` And do the same thing.

<!-- DONE -->
