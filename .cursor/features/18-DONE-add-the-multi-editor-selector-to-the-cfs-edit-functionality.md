# Add The Multi Editor Selector To The Cfs Edit Functionality

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

Right now, when you create a new instruction file, it will prompt you if you want to edit the file and it will show you various editors as options. However, this functionality is not available if you run the following command: `cfs i <category> edit <doc_id>`. For example, `cfs i features edit 9`. I want to add the same multi-editor selection functionality to editing a file. This makes sense since we want the editor functionality to remain consistent. 

## Acceptance criteria
- Add the multi-editor selector to the `cfs edit` functionality.

<!-- DONE -->
