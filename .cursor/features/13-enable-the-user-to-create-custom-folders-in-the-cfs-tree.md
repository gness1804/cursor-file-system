# Enable The User To Create Custom Folders In The Cfs Tree

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

Right now, CFS only works with the designated folders that are present in this file structure, but I would like for the user to have the ability to create new custom folders under the .cursor directory. The command will be something like `cfs instr custom create.` Then the new folder could be used in other commands. For instance, `cfs instr work complete 1`. The custom folder's name would be used like the name of any of the built-in folders in the commands. The program would still fail if you enter a folder name that does not exist. But a custom folder name would be usable with any of the normal CFS commands.
