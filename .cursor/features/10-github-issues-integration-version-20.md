# Github Issues Integration Version 20

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

I would like to integrate the CFS project with GitHub issues. This would involve a way of bi-directional editing between these two types of data. For instance, closing a GitHub issue would automatically mark the CFS issue as done, and vice versa. Same for creating a GitHub issue or a CFS issue. 

This initiative will need a plan to complete, as it would take multiple steps. When starting with this issue, please create a document in the progress folder under the .cursor directory. This document should outline the steps needed to complete the GitHub issues integration.
