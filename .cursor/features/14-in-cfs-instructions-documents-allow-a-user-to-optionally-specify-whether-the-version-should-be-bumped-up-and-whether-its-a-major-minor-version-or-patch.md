# In Cfs Instructions Documents Allow A User To Optionally Specify Whether The Version Should Be Bumped Up And Whether Its A Major Minor Version Or Patch

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

When creating a new instructions document, the user should be prompted to specify if the work contained would result in a version upgrade. If so, they should be further prompted to specify one of three types of versions: major version, minor version, or patch. This is in line with best practices for semantic versioning. If the user creates it, then the version would go under a header in the CFS document.
