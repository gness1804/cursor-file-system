# Expand the `cfs exec` command To be integrated with AI agents other than Claude. 

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

We have already set up Claude Code Integration, which allows the user to call CFS Exec with a Claude flag that starts a Claude Code session with the CFS issue loaded. I want to expand this functionality to include the following AI services:
- Gemini
- Anthropic
- Cursor

We will try to have a similar functionality and logic with these services, but might need to adjust depending on the limitations of the particular service. 

## Acceptance criteria

- The ability to run cfs exec and start a session in each of the AI services listed above.

<!-- DONE -->
