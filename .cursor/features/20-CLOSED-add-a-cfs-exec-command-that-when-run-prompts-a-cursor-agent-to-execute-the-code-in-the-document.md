# Add a CFS exec command that when run prompts a cursor agent to execute the code in the document.

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/cursor-instructions-cli`

## Contents

Example - you run the command `cfs exec bugs 1` and the agent executes the instructions in the relevant document. In later versions, this would hopefully entail integration with the Cursor agent.But in an earlier version, this might simply entail the CLI program spitting out a custom instructions text that you can give to an agent to get started.



## Acceptance criteria

<!-- CLOSED -->
