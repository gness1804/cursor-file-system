Right now, we have two keywords: instructions and rules. The instructions keyword is too long for people to keep typing. Example: `cfs instructions view`. We should use this short form: `instr.` So the equivalent of the preceding command would be: `cfs instr view.` 

It's important that this be backwards compatible. In other words, users should still be able to run the command `cfs instructions ...`. there should just be a short form as well that involves less typing.
